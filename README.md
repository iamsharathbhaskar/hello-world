And this just another repository
I believe that we can only move ahead as a species when we come together and treat each other 
with love, respect and humility. 
And the direction we move in must be towards the highest ideals that we have developed over the millenia,
also we must ensure that we help each and everyone along with us, as we move only as fast as the slowest one of us...
